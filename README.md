# Word Counter
The problem started when I was given a spreadsheet that contained all contact from our web forms. With over 1200 entries, it would've taken awhile to go through them all.

While there are a number of services available on the Internet, I needed something either purely client-based or self-hosted because our spreadsheet contains PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Most of the options already available were submitting to servers and the one I did find that performed the task client-side was a bit sketch. So I made my own.
